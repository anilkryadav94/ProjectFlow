# **App Name**: ProjectFlow

## Core Features:

- Data Table View: Display project data in a sortable and filterable table, showing allocated date, email date, processor, QA, and other relevant columns. Add a date range selector to easily filter date columns
- Data Input Form: Implement a form for data input, allowing end users to update and submit data, which updates the backend SQL database. The processing date should be blank initially. After processing, the user submits the form, and the processing date is automatically entered upon submission, with the same behavior for the QA window.
- Quick Search: Provide a search bar for quickly locating projects by application number, patent number, or ref number.
- Data Export: Allow users to download the project data in CSV format for reporting and analysis.
- Role Based Permissions: Implement role-based view of the information with a filter applied depending on user.
- Manager Window and Email Upload: Implement a manager window in which reports can be generated with date or text, and provide an email upload option to allocate emails with columns (Email date, from, subject, allocation date, processor, qa).
- Excel Data Upload: Enable users to select an Excel file from their desktop with the same header data, and upload the data into the backend.
